# RandomWalk
Random Walk is a simulation in which a walker creates a path by moving in seemingly random directions. The walker's direction is determined by Processing's random() function. RandomWalk has two variations: RandomWalkGrid simulates a walker whose path creates a mosaic. RandomWalkGaussian's walker has its direction determined by a Gaussian distribution.
